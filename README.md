# Reverse Snake

This project is our reimagining of the classic Snake game, Reverse Snake! In classic Snake, the player controls the Snake to locate & eat a food item. In Reverse Snake, the player instead controls the food item to reach a destination without getting eaten by the Snake.

Reverse Snake can be played on the Visual Boy Advance (VBA) emulator. Reverse Snake is written in Assembly & C.

Reverse Snake was built with ❤️ by [Bryan Zheng](), [Haikal Yusuf]() & [Selvavignesh]().

## Sources of Inspiration

Below were various sources that inspired us:
- https://github.com/nikuz/reverse-snake-game
- http://reverse-snake.github.io/ (Reverse Snake where the placement of food is static & we try to crash the snake)
- Coding Dojo's [Reverse Snake](https://youtu.be/zH3zyZ4q0oU) where the food's movement can be controlled & we need to outrun the snake
